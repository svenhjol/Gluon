- investigate glitchy behaviour when trying to place blocks after loading a save
- investigate why husks seem to use zombie sounds and regular husk sounds
- potentially another texture for water
- vanilla 1.13+ textures for trapdoors
- make a list of client side mods people can disable without breaking the pack (and link it on curseforge)
- end city generation (probably needs to be handled by a mod)
- potentially custom advancements
- test if dungeon rarity feels right
- come up with unique concepts for renewable sand, gravel and totems of undying (probably need to be handled by a mod to be more than half decent)
- with new quark version: remove colored slimes and their recipes but the red one, recolor to orange, rename and make recipe use 9 magma cream
