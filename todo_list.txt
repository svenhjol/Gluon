- investigate glitchy behaviour when trying to place blocks after loading a save
- investigate why husks seem to use zombie sounds and regular husk sounds
- potentially another texture for water
- vanilla 1.13+ textures for trapdoors
- decide if bedrock texture change is good enough to keep it (reminder to upload to GH if yes)
- make a list of client side mods people can disable without breaking the pack (and link it on curseforge)
- end city generation (probably needs to be handled by a mod)
- potentially custom advancements
- test if dungeon rarity feels right
- come up with unique concepts for renewable sand, gravel and totems of undying (probably need to be handled by a mod to be more than half decent)
- with new quark version: resistance potions from quartz to crab shell, knock back immunity potions from crab shell to soul beads (crafttweaker)
- with new quark version: remove colored slimes and their recipes but the red one, recolor to orange, rename and make recipe use 9 magma cream

mods that could be interesting to look at:
ido (renamed better swimming)	is now fixing bugs and could replace five feet small since it now has sneaking as well
