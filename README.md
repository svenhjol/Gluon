# Gluon

Gluon is a vanilla+ mod-pack made for an evolving survival experience that can be played without artificial quest goals.

It is trying to keep the vanilla feeling more so than most mod-packs with the "vanilla+" label to it by expanding concepts that already exist in the base game rather than adding a bunch of machines, pipes, equipment items or new dimensions.

The main focus is the sandbox and adding new and interesting game mechanics which should especially be fun for people who like to use redstone. Automation in a close to vanilla environment is often more challenging and complex than playing with mods that add perfect solutions for every situation and also more rewarding in the end!

There are also several new building blocks but in a very muted fashion that can be compared to future versions of minecraft rather than adding hundreds of blocks not backed up by unique recipes. If you just want to play this pack like you would play vanilla the technical content is not forced through artificial progression.

Most of the additional content is added by 3 carefully configured mods which are basically the pillars of this pack:
- Charm
- Quark
- Redstone++

Gluon also ships with a few client-side mods to make life a bit easier for the player, some additions and tweaks to recipes, worldgen and loot tables, fixes for vanilla bugs, texture changes and small mods that change single things like the hopper hitbox or XP-orbs bunching up.
