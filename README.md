# Gluon

Gluon is a vanilla+ modpack made for long lasting survival worlds.

It is trying to keep the vanilla feeling moreso than most modpacks with the "vanilla+" label to it by expanding concepts that already exist in the base game rather than adding a bunch of machines, pipes, equipment items or new dimensions.

The main focus is the sandbox and adding new and interesting game mechanics which should especially be fun for people who like to use redstone. 

There are also several new building blocks but in a very muted fashion that can be compared to future versions of minecraft rather than adding hundreds of blocks not backed up by unique recipes.

Most of the additional content is added by 3 carefully configured mods which are basically the pillars of this pack:
- Charm
- Quark
- Redstone++

It also ships with a few client-side mods to make life a bit easier for the player, some tweaks to recipes, worldgen and loot tables, fixes for vanilla bugs, texture changes and small mods that change single things like the hopper hitbox or XP orbs bunching up.
